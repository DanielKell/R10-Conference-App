# R10 Developer Conference Mobile App

This native mobile app displays the schedule for an upcoming developer conference. It allows users to set certain talks
as favourites, which are then populated in their faves tab. It was built using React Native to support both ios and Android

# Setup
Run `npm install` to install dependencies. In your local development environment, start a React Native packager.

To run the Android simulator: `react-native run-android`

To run the ios simulator: `react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone SE`

Note: The app was designed for smaller sized iphones in an attempt to style for mobile-first/smaller layouts, and scale up.
