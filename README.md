# Project Learnings

The project taught how to build in React Native and highlighted the differences between that and normal React. With the current version of React Native most of the challenges for developing simultaneously for both Andorid and Iphone have been ironed out, but some customization was necessary for custom buttons, navigation, and layouts.
